It was destiny. Da was found 30 hours after her suicide attempt, and was immediately sent to the ICU. Had Da been found 30 minutes later, it would have been too late to save her.</p><p>Three days later, Da awoke, plagued by hallucinations, delusions, mania and depression, fucked yushi off when she came to visit her, saying "Why did you save me? I am being murdered (by delusions)." As Da's mental disorder gradually faded away, Da began to return to reality. The love from the medical team suddenly hit her heart, as she was so weak, to the extent of both physically and mentally disarmed. Da finally realized that love is simple, it is unconditional, or say, infinite. Da is saved.</p><p>Meanwhile, after hearing Da's curse, yushi thought it was her that murdered Da. This misunderstanding made yushi feel so guilty that yushi had suicidal ideation, but she knew she must stay alive to let Da meet her again.</p><p>After nine days in the ICU, Da miraculously made a full recovery. yushi met Da again, and Da met yushi again. The moment they reunited, Da knew, from heart, that she loves yushi, for no reason, and for every reason. Da grasped the chance of the reunion, eventually opened yushi's heart using all the techniques after months of mutual misery, yet understanding, and conveyed what love is to yushi. This time, yushi comprehended what love is, because she experienced and felt what she had never had before. yushi is saved.</p><p>Now, they decide to live the life.</p></dd></dl></div></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','NONE','auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html><!--
